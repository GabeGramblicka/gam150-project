# Allessandro Pesce and the Tugboat Terror
#### Team Name: Complicated Fish

## High Concept:
Tugboat Terror is a game about a mutant fish on a frantic adventure navigating through 
a perilous swamp with his trusty steamboat.

### Gameplay Description:
In this game, you have to manage multiple different tasks throughout the boat, such 
as steering or keeping the boiler fueled. Meanwhile, swamp monsters are trying to hop 
on your boat, and you must fend them off before they can do too much damage. If your 
boat runs out of fuel, then “The Bullfrog” will catch up to your boat and it will be 
game over.

### Detailed Description:
Our protagonist, Alessandro Pesce, is a mutant fish that has grown legs. As he 
travels through the swamp, he’ll quickly realize that he doesn’t have enough fuel. 
Luckily for him, the local wildlife happens to include coal flies, which can be used 
to keep the boat running. But all these coal flies have attracted “The Bullfrog”, a 
swamp monster large enough to sink the boat in a single swipe. The only thing keeping 
Alessandro safe is that his boat is fast enough to outrun the beast, but only if it’s 
running at full speed. Meanwhile, the flies can also damage the boat and the player 
to slow them both down.
The game is split into two separate screens, the map of the swamp and the boat. It 
takes place in the mutated swamps of Louisiana, with a simplistic isometric art style 
that’s hopefully reminiscent of Don’t Starve and Cuphead. The music should be inspired
by upbeat Louisiana Jazz.
