# Tugboat Terror
#### Team Name: Complicated Fish

## High Concept:
Tugboat Terror is a game about a mutant fish on a frantic adventure navigating through 
a perilous swamp on a steamboat.

### Gameplay Description:
In this game, you have to manage multiple different tasks throughout the boat, such 
as steering or keeping the boiler fueled. Meanwhile, coal flies are trying to hop 
on your boat, and you must fend them off before they can do too much damage. If your 
boat runs out of fuel, then “Sheila”, the alligator snapping turtle will catch up to 
your boat and it will be game over.

### Detailed Description:
Our protagonist, Alessandro Pesce, is a mutant fish with legs. As he travels through 
the swamp, he’ll quickly realize that he doesn’t have enough fuel. Luckily for him, 
the local wildlife happens to include coal flies, which can be used to keep the boat 
running. But all these coal flies have attracted Sheila. The only thing keeping Alessandro 
safe is that his boat is fast enough to outrun the beast.Meanwhile, the flies can also 
damage the boat and slow down the player. The game is split into two separate screens, 
the map of the swamp and the boat. It takes place in the mutated swamps of Louisiana, with 
a simplistic 2.5D top-down art style. The music is inspired by upbeat Louisiana Jazz.
